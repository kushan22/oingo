Oingo (Database Project)
Sharing information has never been easy before the web came to the commons in the mobile devices. 
We’re building an app Oingo allowing users to share information through their mobile phones, in the form of notes which can be linked to certain locations at certain times. 
Other users can receive these notes based on their own location, time as well as their preference – thereby essentially creating useful review notes wherever we are and wherever we go. 
This project is a primitive implementation in making Oingo a platform for creation, sharing and access to data in form of these abstract notes based on social, geographical, temporal and keyword data. 
In this project, we implement the idea of Oingo using NodeJS and Express framework, MySQL, in the form of a web-app.
